# Project 1:
# Implement image reconstruction from parallel-projection sinograms using Python.
#
# CAT Scanners (or CT scan) - Computer Axial Tomography
# CT scan: is a special X-ray tests that produce cross-sectional images of the body using X-rays and
#          a computer
# FFTs - Fast Fourieris Transform
# FFT: is an algorithm that samples a signal over a period of time (or space) and divides it
#      into its frequency components
# Laminogram: Reconstruct the sum of the backprojections (i.e. sum of the f(x,y))
# Coplanar rotational laminography (CRL) is a special case of laminography which is a
#  tomographic technique used to image cross-sectional views through solid objects.
#
# Aim:
# (1) Reconstruct an image from the sinogram image (sinogram.png)
# (2) Investigate the behaviour of backprojection reconstruction with ramp-filtering
# (3) Investigate the behaviour of backprojection reconstruction without ramp-filtering
# (4) Investigate the behaviour of backprojection reconstruction with Hamming-windowed ramp-filtering
#
# A display of all the projections for all X-ray angles is called a Sinogram
#
# Rebuild the image from a sum of the 'Backprojections' of the 1-d projection data

Step 1 - Backprojection reconstruction of the sinogram without filtering:
When all the projection angles are combined the projection, the resulting image will
be blurred. This is due to the fact that the resulting image is concentrated towards the
center. (concentrated samples of the image towards the center, and more sparse samples near
the edges). To compensate for this we will need to apply a filter to the output image of the
backprojection such as the ramp filter or the Hamming-windowed ramp-filter








New Steps
(1) - Form the image projections and translate into the frequency domain using the FFT
